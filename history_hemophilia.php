            In the whole history of hemophilia, the Jews were first to recognize it. They enacted a law that if a women had 
            two sons that died from circumcision her third son would not be required to be circumcised. This shows that they
             recognized that women carried the hemophilia gene and passed it down to their sons. </p>

              <h2>Scientific discovery</h2>
              <p class="text-justify"><span class="para">The first medical professional to describe a disease was Abulcasis. 
              In the tenth century he described families whose males died of bleeding after only minor traumas. While many 
              other such descriptive and practical references to the disease appear throughout historical writings, scientific
              analysis did not begin until the start of the nineteenth century.</span><br/> <span class="para">In 1803, 
              Dr. John Conrad Otto, a Philadelphian physician, wrote an account about "a hemorrhagic disposition existing in 
              certain families" in which he called the affected males "bleeders". He recognised that the disorder was hereditary 
              and that it affected mostly males and was passed down by healthy females. His paper was the second paper to describe 
              important characteristics of an X-linked genetic disorder (the first paper being a description of colour blindness 
              by John Dalton who studied his own family). Otto was able to trace the disease back to a woman who settled near 
              Plymouth, NH in 1720. The idea that affected males could pass the trait onto their unaffected daughters was not 
              described until 1813 when John Hay published an account in The New England Journal of Medicine.</span></p>

              <h2>Royal Disease</h2>
              <p class="text-justify">
                <span class="para">The hemophilia blood disorder became known as the royal disease because Queen Victoria was 
                  a carrier and passed the carrier status down to many of her daughters. In those days the royal families of 
                  many of the nations of Europe would marry into each others families.
                  This caused several generations of royalty to become affected by the hemophilia gene. The most famous being 
                  Alexei son of Alexandra and Nicholas, Czar of Russia. Nicholas and Alexandra were pre-occupied by the health 
                  problems of their son at a time when Russia was in turmoil.

                <span class="para">
                  The monk Rasputin gained great influence in the Russian court, partly because he was the only one able to help 
                  the young Tsarevich. He used hypnosis to relieve Alexei's pain. The use of hypnosis not only relieved pain, but 
                  may have also helped slow or stop the boy's hemorrhages. The illness of the heir to the Tsar's throne, the strain 
                  it placed on the Royal family, and the power wielded by the mad monk Rasputin were all factors leading to the 
                  Russian Revolution of 1917.

                    Early 1900s - Fresh blood could be transfused after a sufficient amount was lost. Usually family members would 
                    rally to the aid of the child with hemophilia and donate blood on site. Blood storage was not practible at that 
                    time. Life expectancy for people with hemophilia was 13 years although some lived longer.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1950s - Plasma became available although it did not contain enough of the needed factor.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1965 - Cryoprecipitate “Cryo” improves treatment a bit. Basically “Cryo” was what settled to the bottom of a 
                    bag of plasma. It contained more of the needed factor.It was then frozen and infused, a long hospital procedure.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1970s - Factor concentrates become available.                  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1980s - Factor concentrates infect 80% of the people with hemophilia in the U.S with HIV, many have since 
                    passed away.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1985 - First viral inactivated factor products become available.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1992 - First non plasma derived factor becomes available using recombinant DNA technology.                  
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    1995 - “Prophy” becomes the standard of treatment in the U.S. Instead of waiting for prolonged bleeding to occur, 
                    factor is taken regularly to prevent bleeding and increase quality of life.
